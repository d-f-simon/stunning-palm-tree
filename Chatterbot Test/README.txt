install the followig libraries

 - pip install pipenv
 - pipenv --python 3.7 (doesnt work with 3.8, i'll try and find a workaround for this)
 - pipenv install chatterbot
 - pipenv install flask
 - pipenv install chatterbot_corpus (this will cause some locking issues that I will attempt to solve at some point)

then test with:

- pipenv run app.py
